# Project Report: Features Showcase Component

## Overview
I built a responsive and interactive "Features Showcase" component for a web app. It includes a video carousel with cool 3D effects, navigation controls, and mobile-friendly dots. The goal was to make it visually appealing, functional, and easy to maintain.

## What I Did

### 1. Component Structure
I split the project into four components:
- **`FeaturesShowcase`**: Manages state and renders everything.
- **`FeatureCarousel`**: Handles the video carousel and 3D effects.
- **`FeatureNavigation`**: Provides navigation controls.
- **`FeatureDots`**: Displays dots for mobile navigation.

### 2. State Management
- **`currentIndex`**: Tracks the active feature.
- **`isMobile`**: Detects mobile devices.
- **`carouselRef`**: Controls the carousel programmatically.

### 3. Responsive Design
- Used media queries for mobile styles.
- Updated `isMobile` dynamically on window resize.

### 4. 3D Effects
- Added rotation and translation effects based on scroll.
- Calculated values dynamically for smooth animations.

### 5. Event Handling
- **`handleVideoEnd`**: Auto-plays the next video.
- **Scroll Listener**: Updates effects based on scroll direction.

### 6. Code Readability
- Added comments to explain each section.
- Used clear variable names and organized code logically.

## Key Improvements
1. **Readability**: Added comments and used descriptive names.
2. **Maintainability**: Split code into reusable components.
3. **Performance**: Optimized scroll handling and used `useEffect` for cleanups.

## Conclusion
The "Features Showcase" component is now fully functional, responsive, and easy to maintain. The added comments and structure make it simple for others to understand and extend.
